BOOK ONE: 1805
CHAPTER I
“Well, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the
Buonapartes. But I warn you, if you don’t tell me that this means war, if you
still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that Antichrist—I
really believe he is Antichrist—I will have nothing more to do with you and you
are no longer my friend, no longer my ‘faithful slave,’ as you call yourself!
But how do you do? I see I have frightened you—sit down and tell me all the
news.” It was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna Pávlovna
Schérer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress Márya Fëdorovna. With these
words she greeted Prince Vasíli Kurágin, a man of high rank and importance, who
was the first to arrive at her reception. Anna Pávlovna had had a cough for
some days. She was, as she said, suffering from la grippe; grippe being then a
new word in St. Petersburg, used only by the elite.  All her invitations
without exception, written in French, and delivered by a scarlet-liveried
footman that morning, ran as follows: “If you have nothing better to do, Count
(or Prince), and if the prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is
not too terrible, I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and
10—Annette Schérer.”“Heavens! what a virulent attack!” replied the prince, not
in the least disconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing an
embroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars on his
breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke in that refined
French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought, and with the
gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance who had grown old
in society and at court. He went up to Anna Pávlovna, kissed her hand,
presenting to her his bald, scented, and shining head, and complacently seated
himself on the sofa.“First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your
friend’s mind at rest,” said he without altering his tone, beneath the
politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be
discerned.“Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times
like these if one has any feeling?” said Anna Pávlovna. “You are staying the
whole evening, I hope?”“And the fete at the English ambassador’s? Today is
Wednesday. I must put in an appearance there,” said the prince. “My daughter is
coming for me to take me there.”“I thought today’s fete had been canceled. I
confess all these festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome.”“If they
had known that you wished it, the entertainment would have been put off,” said
the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by force of habit said things he did
not even wish to be believed.“Don’t tease! Well, and what has been decided
about Novosíltsev’s dispatch? You know everything.”“What can one say about it?”
replied the prince in a cold, listless tone. “What has been decided? They have
decided that Buonaparte has burnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to
burn ours.”Prince Vasíli always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating a
stale part. Anna Pávlovna Schérer on the contrary, despite her forty years,
overflowed with animation and impulsiveness. To be an enthusiast had become her
social vocation and, sometimes even when she did not feel like it, she became
enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the expectations of those who knew her.
The subdued smile which, though it did not suit her faded features, always
played round her lips expressed, as in a spoiled child, a continual
consciousness of her charming defect, which she neither wished, nor could, nor
considered it necessary, to correct.In the midst of a conversation on political
matters Anna Pávlovna burst out:“Oh, don’t speak to me of Austria. Perhaps I
don’t understand things, but Austria never has wished, and does not wish, for
war. She is betraying us! Russia alone must save Europe. Our gracious sovereign
recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it. That is the one thing I
have faith in! Our good and wonderful sovereign has to perform the noblest role
on earth, and he is so virtuous and noble that God will not forsake him. He
will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra of revolution, which has become
more terrible than ever in the person of this murderer and villain! We alone
must avenge the blood of the just one.... Whom, I ask you, can we rely on?...
England with her commercial spirit will not and cannot understand the Emperor
Alexander’s loftiness of soul. She has refused to evacuate Malta. She wanted to
find, and still seeks, some secret motive in our actions. What answer did
Novosíltsev get? None. The English have not understood and cannot understand
the self-abnegation of our Emperor who wants nothing for himself, but only
desires the good of mankind. And what have they promised? Nothing! And what
little they have promised they will not perform! Prussia has always declared
that Buonaparte is invincible, and that all Europe is powerless before him....
And I don’t believe a word that Hardenburg says, or Haugwitz either. This
famous Prussian neutrality is just a trap. I have faith only in God and the
lofty destiny of our adored monarch. He will save Europe!”She suddenly paused,
smiling at her own impetuosity.“I think,” said the prince with a smile, “that
if you had been sent instead of our dear Wintzingerode you would have captured
the King of Prussia’s consent by assault. You are so eloquent. Will you give me
a cup of tea?”“In a moment. À propos,” she added, becoming calm again, “I am
expecting two very interesting men tonight, le Vicomte de Mortemart, who is
connected with the Montmorencys through the Rohans, one of the best French
families. He is one of the genuine émigrés, the good ones. And also the Abbé
Morio. Do you know that profound thinker? He has been received by the Emperor.
Had you heard?”“I shall be delighted to meet them,” said the prince. “But tell
me,” he added with studied carelessness as if it had only just occurred to him,
though the question he was about to ask was the chief motive of his visit, “is
it true that the Dowager Empress wants Baron Funke to be appointed first
secretary at Vienna? The baron by all accounts is a poor creature.”Prince
Vasíli wished to obtain this post for his son, but others were trying through
the Dowager Empress Márya Fëdorovna to secure it for the baron.Anna Pávlovna
almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she nor anyone else had a right
to criticize what the Empress desired or was pleased with.“Baron Funke has been
recommended to the Dowager Empress by her sister,” was all she said, in a dry
and mournful tone.As she named the Empress, Anna Pávlovna’s face suddenly
assumed an expression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with
sadness, and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious patroness.
She added that Her Majesty had deigned to show Baron Funke beaucoup d’estime,
and again her face clouded over with sadness.The prince was silent and looked
indifferent. But, with the womanly and courtierlike quickness and tact habitual
to her, Anna Pávlovna wished both to rebuke him (for daring to speak as he had
done of a man recommended to the Empress) and at the same time to console him,
so she said:“Now about your family. Do you know that since your daughter came
out everyone has been enraptured by her? They say she is amazingly
beautiful.”The prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude.“I often
think,” she continued after a short pause, drawing nearer to the prince and
smiling amiably at him as if to show that political and social topics were
ended and the time had come for intimate conversation—“I often think how
unfairly sometimes the joys of life are distributed. Why has fate given you two
such splendid children? I don’t speak of Anatole, your youngest. I don’t like
him,” she added in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrows.
“Two such charming children. And really you appreciate them less than anyone,
and so you don’t deserve to have them.”And she smiled her ecstatic smile.“I
can’t help it,” said the prince. “Lavater would have said I lack the bump of
paternity.”“Don’t joke; I mean to have a serious talk with you. Do you know I
am dissatisfied with your younger son? Between ourselves” (and her face assumed
its melancholy expression), “he was mentioned at Her Majesty’s and you were
pitied....”The prince answered nothing, but she looked at him significantly,
awaiting a reply. He frowned.“What would you have me do?” he said at last. “You
know I did all a father could for their education, and they have both turned
out fools. Hippolyte is at least a quiet fool, but Anatole is an active one.
That is the only difference between them.” He said this smiling in a way more
natural and animated than usual, so that the wrinkles round his mouth very
clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse and unpleasant.“And why are
children born to such men as you? If you were not a father there would be
nothing I could reproach you with,” said Anna Pávlovna, looking up pensively.“I
am your faithful slave and to you alone I can confess that my children are the
bane of my life. It is the cross I have to bear. That is how I explain it to
myself. It can’t be helped!”He said no more, but expressed his resignation to
cruel fate by a gesture. Anna Pávlovna meditated.“Have you never thought of
marrying your prodigal son Anatole?” she asked. “They say old maids have a
mania for matchmaking, and though I don’t feel that weakness in myself as yet,
I know a little person who is very unhappy with her father. She is a relation
of yours, Princess Mary Bolkónskaya.”Prince Vasíli did not reply, though, with
the quickness of memory and perception befitting a man of the world, he
indicated by a movement of the head that he was considering this
information.“Do you know,” he said at last, evidently unable to check the sad
current of his thoughts, “that Anatole is costing me forty thousand rubles a
year? And,” he went on after a pause, “what will it be in five years, if he
goes on like this?” Presently he added: “That’s what we fathers have to put up
with.... Is this princess of yours rich?”“Her father is very rich and stingy.
He lives in the country. He is the well-known Prince Bolkónski who had to
retire from the army under the late Emperor, and was nicknamed ‘the King of
Prussia.’ He is very clever but eccentric, and a bore. The poor girl is very
unhappy. She has a brother; I think you know him, he married Lise Meinen
lately. He is an aide-de-camp of Kutúzov’s and will be here tonight.”“Listen,
dear Annette,” said the prince, suddenly taking Anna Pávlovna’s hand and for
some reason drawing it downwards. “Arrange that affair for me and I shall
always be your most devoted slave-slafe with an f, as a village elder of mine
writes in his reports. She is rich and of good family and that’s all I
want.”And with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him, he raised the
maid of honor’s hand to his lips, kissed it, and swung it to and fro as he lay
back in his armchair, looking in another direction.“Attendez,” said Anna
Pávlovna, reflecting, “I’ll speak to Lise, young Bolkónski’s wife, this very
evening, and perhaps the thing can be arranged. It shall be on your family’s
behalf that I’ll start my apprenticeship as old maid.”CHAPTER II Anna
Pávlovna’s drawing room was gradually filling. The highest Petersburg society
was assembled there: people differing widely in age and character but alike in
the social circle to which they belonged. Prince Vasíli’s daughter, the
beautiful Hélène, came to take her father to the ambassador’s entertainment;
she wore a ball dress and her badge as maid of honor. The youthful little
Princess Bolkónskaya, known as la femme la plus séduisante de Pétersbourg, *
was also there. She had been married during the previous winter, and being
pregnant did not go to any large gatherings, but only to small receptions.
Prince Vasíli’s son, Hippolyte, had come with Mortemart, whom he introduced.
The Abbé Morio and many others had also come.* The most fascinating woman in
Petersburg.To each new arrival Anna Pávlovna said, “You have not yet seen my
aunt,” or “You do not know my aunt?” and very gravely conducted him or her to a
little old lady, wearing large bows of ribbon in her cap, who had come sailing
in from another room as soon as the guests began to arrive; and slowly turning
her eyes from the visitor to her aunt, Anna Pávlovna mentioned each one’s name
and then left them.Each visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old
aunt whom not one of them knew, not one of them wanted to know, and not one of
them cared about; Anna Pávlovna observed these greetings with mournful and
solemn interest and silent approval. The aunt spoke to each of them in the same
words, about their health and her own, and the health of Her Majesty, “who,
thank God, was better today.” And each visitor, though politeness prevented his
showing impatience, left the old woman with a sense of relief at having
performed a vexatious duty and did not return to her the whole evening.The
young Princess Bolkónskaya had brought some work in a gold-embroidered velvet
bag. Her pretty little upper lip, on which a delicate dark down was just
perceptible, was too short for her teeth, but it lifted all the more sweetly,
and was especially charming when she occasionally drew it down to meet the
lower lip. As is always the case with a thoroughly attractive woman, her
defect—the shortness of her upper lip and her half-open mouth—seemed to be her
own special and peculiar form of beauty. Everyone brightened at the sight of
this pretty young woman, so soon to become a mother, so full of life and
health, and carrying her burden so lightly. Old men and dull dispirited young
ones who looked at her, after being in her company and talking to her a little
while, felt as if they too were becoming, like her, full of life and health.
All who talked to her, and at each word saw her bright smile and the constant
gleam of her white teeth, thought that they were in a specially amiable mood
that day.The little princess went round the table with quick, short, swaying
steps, her workbag on her arm, and gaily spreading out her dress sat down on a
sofa near the silver samovar, as if all she was doing was a pleasure to herself
and to all around her. “I have brought my work,” said she in French, displaying
her bag and addressing all present. “Mind, Annette, I hope you have not played
a wicked trick on me,” she added, turning to her hostess. “You wrote that it
was to be quite a small reception, and just see how badly I am dressed.” And
she spread out her arms to show her short-waisted, lace-trimmed, dainty gray
dress, girdled with a broad ribbon just below the breast.“Soyez tranquille,
Lise, you will always be prettier than anyone else,” replied Anna Pávlovna.“You
know,” said the princess in the same tone of voice and still in French, turning
to a general, “my husband is deserting me? He is going to get himself killed.
Tell me what this wretched war is for?” she added, addressing Prince Vasíli,
and without waiting for an answer she turned to speak to his daughter, the
beautiful Hélène.“What a delightful woman this little princess is!” said Prince
Vasíli to Anna Pávlovna.One of the next arrivals was a stout, heavily built
young man with close-cropped hair, spectacles, the light-colored breeches
fashionable at that time, a very high ruffle, and a brown dress coat. This
stout young man was an illegitimate son of Count Bezúkhov, a well-known grandee
of Catherine’s time who now lay dying in Moscow. The young man had not yet
entered either the military or civil service, as he had only just returned from
abroad where he had been educated, and this was his first appearance in
society. Anna Pávlovna greeted him with the nod she accorded to the lowest
hierarchy in her drawing room. But in spite of this lowest-grade greeting, a
look of anxiety and fear, as at the sight of something too large and unsuited
to the place, came over her face when she saw Pierre enter. Though he was
certainly rather bigger than the other men in the room, her anxiety could only
have reference to the clever though shy, but observant and natural, expression
which distinguished him from everyone else in that drawing room.“It is very
good of you, Monsieur Pierre, to come and visit a poor invalid,” said Anna
Pávlovna, exchanging an alarmed glance with her aunt as she conducted him to
her.Pierre murmured something unintelligible, and continued to look round as if
in search of something. On his way to the aunt he bowed to the little princess
with a pleased smile, as to an intimate acquaintance.Anna Pávlovna’s alarm was
justified, for Pierre turned away from the aunt without waiting to hear her
speech about Her Majesty’s health. Anna Pávlovna in dismay detained him with
the words: “Do you know the Abbé Morio? He is a most interesting man.”“Yes, I
have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace, and it is very interesting but
hardly feasible.”“You think so?” rejoined Anna Pávlovna in order to say
something and get away to attend to her duties as hostess. But Pierre now
committed a reverse act of impoliteness. First he had left a lady before she
had finished speaking to him, and now he continued to speak to another who
wished to get away. With his head bent, and his big feet spread apart, he began
explaining his reasons for thinking the abbé’s plan chimerical.“We will talk of
it later,” said Anna Pávlovna with a smile.And having got rid of this young man
who did not know how to behave, she resumed her duties as hostess and continued
to listen and watch, ready to help at any point where the conversation might
happen to flag. As the foreman of a spinning mill, when he has set the hands to
work, goes round and notices here a spindle that has stopped or there one that
creaks or makes more noise than it should, and hastens to check the machine or
set it in proper motion, so Anna Pávlovna moved about her drawing room,
approaching now a silent, now a too-noisy group, and by a word or slight
rearrangement kept the conversational machine in steady, proper, and regular
motion. But amid these cares her anxiety about Pierre was evident. She kept an
anxious watch on him when he approached the group round Mortemart to listen to
what was being said there, and again when he passed to another group whose
center was the abbé.Pierre had been educated abroad, and this reception at Anna
Pávlovna’s was the first he had attended in Russia. He knew that all the
intellectual lights of Petersburg were gathered there and, like a child in a
toyshop, did not know which way to look, afraid of missing any clever
conversation that was to be heard. Seeing the self-confident and refined
expression on the faces of those present he was always expecting to hear
something very profound. At last he came up to Morio. Here the conversation
seemed interesting and he stood waiting for an opportunity to express his own
views, as young people are fond of doing.CHAPTER III Anna Pávlovna’s reception
was in full swing. The spindles hummed steadily and ceaselessly on all sides.
With the exception of the aunt, beside whom sat only one elderly lady, who with
her thin careworn face was rather out of place in this brilliant society, the
whole company had settled into three groups. One, chiefly masculine, had formed
round the abbé. Another, of young people, was grouped round the beautiful
Princess Hélène, Prince Vasíli’s daughter, and the little Princess Bolkónskaya,
very pretty and rosy, though rather too plump for her age. The third group was
gathered round Mortemart and Anna Pávlovna.The vicomte was a nice-looking young
man with soft features and polished manners, who evidently considered himself a
celebrity but out of politeness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the
circle in which he found himself. Anna Pávlovna was obviously serving him up as
a treat to her guests. As a clever maître d’hôtel serves up as a specially
choice delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seen it in the kitchen
would have cared to eat, so Anna Pávlovna served up to her guests, first the
vicomte and then the abbé, as peculiarly choice morsels. The group about
Mortemart immediately began discussing the murder of the Duc d’Enghien. The
vicomte said that the Duc d’Enghien had perished by his own magnanimity, and
that there were particular reasons for Buonaparte’s hatred of him.“Ah, yes! Do
tell us all about it, Vicomte,” said Anna Pávlovna, with a pleasant feeling
that there was something à la Louis XV in the sound of that sentence: “Contez
nous çela, Vicomte.”The vicomte bowed and smiled courteously in token of his
willingness to comply. Anna Pávlovna arranged a group round him, inviting
everyone to listen to his tale.“The vicomte knew the duc personally,” whispered
Anna Pávlovna to one of the guests. “The vicomte is a wonderful raconteur,”
said she to another. “How evidently he belongs to the best society,” said she
to a third; and the vicomte was served up to the company in the choicest and
most advantageous style, like a well-garnished joint of roast beef on a hot
dish.The vicomte wished to begin his story and gave a subtle smile.“Come over
here, Hélène, dear,” said Anna Pávlovna to the beautiful young princess who was
sitting some way off, the center of another group.The princess smiled. She rose
with the same unchanging smile with which she had first entered the room—the
smile of a perfectly beautiful woman. With a slight rustle of her white dress
trimmed with moss and ivy, with a gleam of white shoulders, glossy hair, and
sparkling diamonds, she passed between the men who made way for her, not
looking at any of them but smiling on all, as if graciously allowing each the
privilege of admiring her beautiful figure and shapely shoulders, back, and
bosom—which in the fashion of those days were very much exposed—and she seemed
to bring the glamour of a ballroom with her as she moved toward Anna Pávlovna.
Hélène was so lovely that not only did she not show any trace of coquetry, but
on the contrary she even appeared shy of her unquestionable and all too
victorious beauty. She seemed to wish, but to be unable, to diminish its
effect.“How lovely!” said everyone who saw her; and the vicomte lifted his
shoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by something extraordinary when
she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him also with her unchanging
smile.“Madame, I doubt my ability before such an audience,” said he, smilingly
inclining his head.The princess rested her bare round arm on a little table and
considered a reply unnecessary. She smilingly waited. All the time the story
was being told she sat upright, glancing now at her beautiful round arm,
altered in shape by its pressure on the table, now at her still more beautiful
bosom, on which she readjusted a diamond necklace. From time to time she
smoothed the folds of her dress, and whenever the story produced an effect she
glanced at Anna Pávlovna, at once adopted just the expression she saw on the
maid of honor’s face, and again relapsed into her radiant smile.The little
princess had also left the tea table and followed Hélène.“Wait a moment, I’ll
get my work.... Now then, what are you thinking of?” she went on, turning to
Prince Hippolyte. “Fetch me my workbag.”There was a general movement as the
princess, smiling and talking merrily to everyone at once, sat down and gaily
arranged herself in her seat.“Now I am all right,” she said, and asking the
vicomte to begin, she took up her work.Prince Hippolyte, having brought the
workbag, joined the circle and moving a chair close to hers seated himself
beside her.Le charmant Hippolyte was surprising by his extraordinary
resemblance to his beautiful sister, but yet more by the fact that in spite of
this resemblance he was exceedingly ugly. His features were like his sister’s,
but while in her case everything was lit up by a joyous, self-satisfied,
youthful, and constant smile of animation, and by the wonderful classic beauty
of her figure, his face on the contrary was dulled by imbecility and a constant
expression of sullen self-confidence, while his body was thin and weak. His
eyes, nose, and mouth all seemed puckered into a vacant, wearied grimace, and
his arms and legs always fell into unnatural positions.“It’s not going to be a
ghost story?” said he, sitting down beside the princess and hastily adjusting
his lorgnette, as if without this instrument he could not begin to speak.“Why
no, my dear fellow,” said the astonished narrator, shrugging his
shoulders.“Because I hate ghost stories,” said Prince Hippolyte in a tone which
showed that he only understood the meaning of his words after he had uttered
them.He spoke with such self-confidence that his hearers could not be sure
whether what he said was very witty or very stupid. He was dressed in a
dark-green dress coat, knee breeches of the color of cuisse de nymphe effrayée,
as he called it, shoes, and silk stockings.The vicomte told his tale very
neatly. It was an anecdote, then current, to the effect that the Duc d’Enghien
had gone secretly to Paris to visit Mademoiselle George; that at her house he
came upon Bonaparte, who also enjoyed the famous actress’ favors, and that in
his presence Napoleon happened to fall into one of the fainting fits to which
he was subject, and was thus at the duc’s mercy. The latter spared him, and
this magnanimity Bonaparte subsequently repaid by death.The story was very
pretty and interesting, especially at the point where the rivals suddenly
recognized one another; and the ladies looked agitated.“Charming!” said Anna
Pávlovna with an inquiring glance at the little princess.“Charming!” whispered
the little princess, sticking the needle into her work as if to testify that
the interest and fascination of the story prevented her from going on with
it.The vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefully prepared
to continue, but just then Anna Pávlovna, who had kept a watchful eye on the
young man who so alarmed her, noticed that he was talking too loudly and
vehemently with the abbé, so she hurried to the rescue. Pierre had managed to
start a conversation with the abbé about the balance of power, and the latter,
evidently interested by the young man’s simple-minded eagerness, was explaining
his pet theory. Both were talking and listening too eagerly and too naturally,
which was why Anna Pávlovna disapproved.“The means are ... the balance of power
in Europe and the rights of the people,” the abbé was saying. “It is only
necessary for one powerful nation like Russia—barbaric as she is said to be—to
place herself disinterestedly at the head of an alliance having for its object
the maintenance of the balance of power of Europe, and it would save the
world!”“But how are you to get that balance?” Pierre was beginning.At that
moment Anna Pávlovna came up and, looking severely at Pierre, asked the Italian
how he stood Russian climate. The Italian’s face instantly changed and assumed
an offensively affected, sugary expression, evidently habitual to him when
conversing with women.“I am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and
culture of the society, more especially of the feminine society, in which I
have had the honor of being received, that I have not yet had time to think of
the climate,” said he.Not letting the abbé and Pierre escape, Anna Pávlovna,
the more conveniently to keep them under observation, brought them into the
larger circle.CHAPTER IV Just then another visitor entered the drawing room:
Prince Andrew Bolkónski, the little princess’ husband. He was a very handsome
young man, of medium height, with firm, clearcut features. Everything about
him, from his weary, bored expression to his quiet, measured step, offered a
most striking contrast to his quiet, little wife. It was evident that he not
only knew everyone in the drawing room, but had found them to be so tiresome
that it wearied him to look at or listen to them. And among all these faces
that he found so tedious, none seemed to bore him so much as that of his pretty
wife. He turned away from her with a grimace that distorted his handsome face,
kissed Anna Pávlovna’s hand, and screwing up his eyes scanned the whole
company.“You are off to the war, Prince?” said Anna Pávlovna.“General Kutúzov,”
said Bolkónski, speaking French and stressing the last syllable of the
general’s name like a Frenchman, “has been pleased to take me as an
aide-de-camp....”“And Lise, your wife?”“She will go to the country.”“Are you
not ashamed to deprive us of your charming wife?”“André,” said his wife,
addressing her husband in the same coquettish manner in which she spoke to
other men, “the vicomte has been telling us such a tale about Mademoiselle
George and Buonaparte!”Prince Andrew screwed up his eyes and turned away.
Pierre, who from the moment Prince Andrew entered the room had watched him with
glad, affectionate eyes, now came up and took his arm. Before he looked round
Prince Andrew frowned again, expressing his annoyance with whoever was touching
his arm, but when he saw Pierre’s beaming face he gave him an unexpectedly kind
and pleasant smile.“There now!... So you, too, are in the great world?” said he
to Pierre.“I knew you would be here,” replied Pierre. “I will come to supper
with you. May I?” he added in a low voice so as not to disturb the vicomte who
was continuing his story.“No, impossible!” said Prince Andrew, laughing and
pressing Pierre’s hand to show that there was no need to ask the question. He
wished to say something more, but at that moment Prince Vasíli and his daughter
got up to go and the two young men rose to let them pass.“You must excuse me,
dear Vicomte,” said Prince Vasíli to the Frenchman, holding him down by the
sleeve in a friendly way to prevent his rising. “This unfortunate fete at the
ambassador’s deprives me of a pleasure, and obliges me to interrupt you. I am
very sorry to leave your enchanting party,” said he, turning to Anna
Pávlovna.His daughter, Princess Hélène, passed between the chairs, lightly
holding up the folds of her dress, and the smile shone still more radiantly on
her beautiful face. Pierre gazed at her with rapturous, almost frightened, eyes
as she passed him.“Very lovely,” said Prince Andrew.“Very,” said Pierre.In
passing Prince Vasíli seized Pierre’s hand and said to Anna Pávlovna: “Educate
this bear for me! He has been staying with me a whole month and this is the
first time I have seen him in society. Nothing is so necessary for a young man
as the society of clever women.” Anna Pávlovna smiled and promised to take
Pierre in hand. She knew his father to be a connection of Prince Vasíli’s. The
elderly lady who had been sitting with the old aunt rose hurriedly and overtook
Prince Vasíli in the anteroom. All the affectation of interest she had assumed
had left her kindly and tear-worn face and it now expressed only anxiety and
fear.“How about my son Borís, Prince?” said she, hurrying after him into the
anteroom. “I can’t remain any longer in Petersburg. Tell me what news I may
take back to my poor boy.”Although Prince Vasíli listened reluctantly and not
very politely to the elderly lady, even betraying some impatience, she gave him
an ingratiating and appealing smile, and took his hand that he might not go
away.“What would it cost you to say a word to the Emperor, and then he would be
transferred to the Guards at once?” said she.“Believe me, Princess, I am ready
to do all I can,” answered Prince Vasíli, “but it is difficult for me to ask
the Emperor. I should advise you to appeal to Rumyántsev through Prince
Golítsyn. That would be the best way.”The elderly lady was a Princess
Drubetskáya, belonging to one of the best families in Russia, but she was poor,
and having long been out of society had lost her former influential
connections. She had now come to Petersburg to procure an appointment in the
Guards for her only son. It was, in fact, solely to meet Prince Vasíli that she
had obtained an invitation to Anna Pávlovna’s reception and had sat listening
to the vicomte’s story. Prince Vasíli’s words frightened her, an embittered
look clouded her once handsome face, but only for a moment; then she smiled
again and clutched Prince Vasíli’s arm more tightly.“Listen to me, Prince,”
said she. “I have never yet asked you for anything and I never will again, nor
have I ever reminded you of my father’s friendship for you; but now I entreat
you for God’s sake to do this for my son—and I shall always regard you as a
benefactor,” she added hurriedly. “No, don’t be angry, but promise! I have
asked Golítsyn and he has refused. Be the kindhearted man you always were,” she
said, trying to smile though tears were in her eyes.“Papa, we shall be late,”
said Princess Hélène, turning her beautiful head and looking over her
classically molded shoulder as she stood waiting by the door.Influence in
society, however, is a capital which has to be economized if it is to last.
Prince Vasíli knew this, and having once realized that if he asked on behalf of
all who begged of him, he would soon be unable to ask for himself, he became
chary of using his influence. But in Princess Drubetskáya’s case he felt, after
her second appeal, something like qualms of conscience. She had reminded him of
what was quite true; he had been indebted to her father for the first steps in
his career. Moreover, he could see by her manners that she was one of those
women—mostly mothers—who, having once made up their minds, will not rest until
they have gained their end, and are prepared if necessary to go on insisting
day after day and hour after hour, and even to make scenes. This last
consideration moved him.“My dear Anna Mikháylovna,” said he with his usual
familiarity and weariness of tone, “it is almost impossible for me to do what
you ask; but to prove my devotion to you and how I respect your father’s
memory, I will do the impossible—your son shall be transferred to the Guards.
Here is my hand on it. Are you satisfied?”“My dear benefactor! This is what I
expected from you—I knew your kindness!” He turned to go.“Wait—just a word!
When he has been transferred to the Guards...” she faltered. “You are on good
terms with Michael Ilariónovich Kutúzov ... recommend Borís to him as adjutant!
Then I shall be at rest, and then...”Prince Vasíli smiled.“No, I won’t promise
that. You don’t know how Kutúzov is pestered since his appointment as Commander
in Chief. He told me himself that all the Moscow ladies have conspired to give
him all their sons as adjutants.”“No, but do promise! I won’t let you go! My
dear benefactor...”“Papa,” said his beautiful daughter in the same tone as
before, “we shall be late.”“Well, au revoir! Good-by! You hear her?”“Then
tomorrow you will speak to the Emperor?”“Certainly; but about Kutúzov, I don’t
promise.”“Do promise, do promise, Vasíli!” cried Anna Mikháylovna as he went,
with the smile of a coquettish girl, which at one time probably came naturally
to her, but was now very ill-suited to her careworn face.Apparently she had
forgotten her age and by force of habit employed all the old feminine arts. But
as soon as the prince had gone her face resumed its former cold, artificial
expression. She returned to the group where the vicomte was still talking, and
again pretended to listen, while waiting till it would be time to leave. Her
task was accomplished.CHAPTER V “And what do you think of this latest comedy,
the coronation at Milan?” asked Anna Pávlovna, “and of the comedy of the people
of Genoa and Lucca laying their petitions before Monsieur Buonaparte, and
Monsieur Buonaparte sitting on a throne and granting the petitions of the
nations? Adorable! It is enough to make one’s head whirl! It is as if the whole
world had gone crazy.”Prince Andrew looked Anna Pávlovna straight in the face
with a sarcastic smile.“‘Dieu me la donne, gare à qui la touche!’’ * They say
he was very fine when he said that,” he remarked, repeating the words in
Italian: “‘Dio mi l’ha dato. Guai a chi la tocchi!’’* God has given it to me,
let him who touches it beware!“I hope this will prove the last drop that will
make the glass run over,” Anna Pávlovna continued. “The sovereigns will not be
able to endure this man who is a menace to everything.”“The sovereigns? I do
not speak of Russia,” said the vicomte, polite but hopeless: “The sovereigns,
madame... What have they done for Louis XVII, for the Queen, or for Madame
Elizabeth? Nothing!” and he became more animated. “And believe me, they are
reaping the reward of their betrayal of the Bourbon cause. The sovereigns! Why,
they are sending ambassadors to compliment the usurper.”And sighing
disdainfully, he again changed his position.Prince Hippolyte, who had been
gazing at the vicomte for some time through his lorgnette, suddenly turned
completely round toward the little princess, and having asked for a needle
began tracing the Condé coat of arms on the table. He explained this to her
with as much gravity as if she had asked him to do it.“Bâton de gueules,
engrêlé de gueules d’azur—maison Condé,” said he.The princess listened,
smiling.“If Buonaparte remains on the throne of France a year longer,” the
vicomte continued, with the air of a man who, in a matter with which he is
better acquainted than anyone else, does not listen to others but follows the
current of his own thoughts, “things will have gone too far. By intrigues,
violence, exile, and executions, French society—I mean good French society—will
have been forever destroyed, and then....”He shrugged his shoulders and spread
out his hands. Pierre wished to make a remark, for the conversation interested
him, but Anna Pávlovna, who had him under observation, interrupted:“The Emperor
Alexander,” said she, with the melancholy which always accompanied any
reference of hers to the Imperial family, “has declared that he will leave it
to the French people themselves to choose their own form of government; and I
believe that once free from the usurper, the whole nation will certainly throw
itself into the arms of its rightful king,” she concluded, trying to be amiable
to the royalist emigrant.“That is doubtful,” said Prince Andrew. “Monsieur le
Vicomte quite rightly supposes that matters have already gone too far. I think
it will be difficult to return to the old regime.”“From what I have heard,”
said Pierre, blushing and breaking into the conversation, “almost all the
aristocracy has already gone over to Bonaparte’s side.”“It is the Buonapartists
who say that,” replied the vicomte without looking at Pierre. “At the present
time it is difficult to know the real state of French public
opinion.”“Bonaparte has said so,” remarked Prince Andrew with a sarcastic
smile.It was evident that he did not like the vicomte and was aiming his
remarks at him, though without looking at him.“‘I showed them the path to
glory, but they did not follow it,’” Prince Andrew continued after a short
silence, again quoting Napoleon’s words. “‘I opened my antechambers and they
crowded in.’ I do not know how far he was justified in saying so.”“Not in the
least,” replied the vicomte. “After the murder of the duc even the most partial
ceased to regard him as a hero. If to some people,” he went on, turning to Anna
Pávlovna, “he ever was a hero, after the murder of the duc there was one martyr
more in heaven and one hero less on earth.”Before Anna Pávlovna and the others
had time to smile their appreciation of the vicomte’s epigram, Pierre again
broke into the conversation, and though Anna Pávlovna felt sure he would say
something inappropriate, she was unable to stop him.“The execution of the Duc
d’Enghien,” declared Monsieur Pierre, “was a political necessity, and it seems
to me that Napoleon showed greatness of soul by not fearing to take on himself
the whole responsibility of that deed.”“Dieu! Mon Dieu!” muttered Anna Pávlovna
in a terrified whisper.“What, Monsieur Pierre... Do you consider that
assassination shows greatness of soul?” said the little princess, smiling and
drawing her work nearer to her.“Oh! Oh!” exclaimed several voices.“Capital!”
said Prince Hippolyte in English, and began slapping his knee with the palm of
his hand.The vicomte merely shrugged his shoulders. Pierre looked solemnly at
his audience over his spectacles and continued.“I say so,” he continued
desperately, “because the Bourbons fled from the Revolution leaving the people
to anarchy, and Napoleon alone understood the Revolution and quelled it, and so
for the general good, he could not stop short for the sake of one man’s
life.”“Won’t you come over to the other table?” suggested Anna Pávlovna.But
Pierre continued his speech without heeding her.“No,” cried he, becoming more
and more eager, “Napoleon is great because he rose superior to the Revolution,
suppressed its abuses, preserved all that was good in it—equality of
citizenship and freedom of speech and of the press—and only for that reason did
he obtain power.”“Yes, if having obtained power, without availing himself of it
to commit murder he had restored it to the rightful king, I should have called
him a great man,” remarked the vicomte.“He could not do that. The people only
gave him power that he might rid them of the Bourbons and because they saw that
he was a great man. The Revolution was a grand thing!” continued Monsieur
Pierre, betraying by this desperate and provocative proposition his extreme
youth and his wish to express all that was in his mind.“What? Revolution and
regicide a grand thing?... Well, after that... But won’t you come to this other
table?” repeated Anna Pávlovna.“Rousseau’s Contrat Social,” said the vicomte
with a tolerant smile.“I am not speaking of regicide, I am speaking about
ideas.”“Yes: ideas of robbery, murder, and regicide,” again interjected an
ironical voice.“Those were extremes, no doubt, but they are not what is most
important. What is important are the rights of man, emancipation from
prejudices, and equality of citizenship, and all these ideas Napoleon has
retained in full force.”“Liberty and equality,” said the vicomte
contemptuously, as if at last deciding seriously to prove to this youth how
foolish his words were, “high-sounding words which have long been discredited.
Who does not love liberty and equality? Even our Saviour preached liberty and
equality. Have people since the Revolution become happier? On the contrary. We
wanted liberty, but Buonaparte has destroyed it.”Prince Andrew kept looking
with an amused smile from Pierre to the vicomte and from the vicomte to their
hostess. In the first moment of Pierre’s outburst Anna Pávlovna, despite her
social experience, was horror-struck. But when she saw that Pierre’s
sacrilegious words had not exasperated the vicomte, and had convinced herself
that it was impossible to stop him, she rallied her forces and joined the
vicomte in a vigorous attack on the orator.“But, my dear Monsieur Pierre,” said
she, “how do you explain the fact of a great man executing a duc—or even an
ordinary man who—is innocent and untried?”“I should like,” said the vicomte,
“to ask how monsieur explains the 18th Brumaire; was not that an imposture? It
was a swindle, and not at all like the conduct of a great man!”“And the
prisoners he killed in Africa? That was horrible!” said the little princess,
shrugging her shoulders.“He’s a low fellow, say what you will,” remarked Prince
Hippolyte.Pierre, not knowing whom to answer, looked at them all and smiled.
His smile was unlike the half-smile of other people. When he smiled, his grave,
even rather gloomy, look was instantaneously replaced by another—a childlike,
kindly, even rather silly look, which seemed to ask forgiveness.The vicomte who
was meeting him for the first time saw clearly that this young Jacobin was not
so terrible as his words suggested. All were silent.“How do you expect him to
answer you all at once?” said Prince Andrew. “Besides, in the actions of a
statesman one has to distinguish between his acts as a private person, as a
general, and as an emperor. So it seems to me.”“Yes, yes, of course!” Pierre
chimed in, pleased at the arrival of this reinforcement.“One must admit,”
continued Prince Andrew, “that Napoleon as a man was great on the bridge of
Arcola, and in the hospital at Jaffa where he gave his hand to the
plague-stricken; but ... but there are other acts which it is difficult to
justify.”Prince Andrew, who had evidently wished to tone down the awkwardness
of Pierre’s remarks, rose and made a sign to his wife that it was time to
go.Suddenly Prince Hippolyte started up making signs to everyone to attend, and
asking them all to be seated began:“I was told a charming Moscow story today
and must treat you to it. Excuse me, Vicomte—I must tell it in Russian or the
point will be lost....” And Prince Hippolyte began to tell his story in such
Russian as a Frenchman would speak after spending about a year in Russia.
Everyone waited, so emphatically and eagerly did he demand their attention to
his story.“There is in Moscow a lady, une dame, and she is very stingy. She
must have two footmen behind her carriage, and very big ones. That was her
taste. And she had a lady’s maid, also big. She said....”Here Prince Hippolyte
paused, evidently collecting his ideas with difficulty.“She said.... Oh yes!
She said, ‘Girl,’ to the maid, ‘put on a livery, get up behind the carriage,
and come with me while I make some calls.’”Here Prince Hippolyte spluttered and
burst out laughing long before his audience, which produced an effect
unfavorable to the narrator. Several persons, among them the elderly lady and
Anna Pávlovna, did however smile.“She went. Suddenly there was a great wind.
The girl lost her hat and her long hair came down....” Here he could contain
himself no longer and went on, between gasps of laughter: “And the whole world
knew....”And so the anecdote ended. Though it was unintelligible why he had
told it, or why it had to be told in Russian, still Anna Pávlovna and the
others appreciated Prince Hippolyte’s social tact in so agreeably ending
Pierre’s unpleasant and unamiable outburst. After the anecdote the conversation
broke up into insignificant small talk about the last and next balls, about
theatricals, and who would meet whom, and when and where.CHAPTER VI Having
thanked Anna Pávlovna for her charming soiree, the guests began to take their
leave.Pierre was ungainly. Stout, about the average height, broad, with huge
red hands; he did not know, as the saying is, how to enter a drawing room and
still less how to leave one; that is, how to say something particularly
agreeable before going away. Besides this he was absent-minded. When he rose to
go, he took up instead of his own, the general’s three-cornered hat, and held
it, pulling at the plume, till the general asked him to restore it. All his
absent-mindedness and inability to enter a room and converse in it was,
however, redeemed by his kindly, simple, and modest expression. Anna Pávlovna
turned toward him and, with a Christian mildness that expressed forgiveness of
his indiscretion, nodded and said: “I hope to see you again, but I also hope
you will change your opinions, my dear Monsieur Pierre.”When she said this, he
did not reply and only bowed, but again everybody saw his smile, which said
nothing, unless perhaps, “Opinions are opinions, but you see what a capital,
good-natured fellow I am.” And everyone, including Anna Pávlovna, felt
this.Prince Andrew had gone out into the hall, and, turning his shoulders to
the footman who was helping him on with his cloak, listened indifferently to
his wife’s chatter with Prince Hippolyte who had also come into the hall.
Prince Hippolyte stood close to the pretty, pregnant princess, and stared
fixedly at her through his eyeglass.“Go in, Annette, or you will catch cold,”
said the little princess, taking leave of Anna Pávlovna. “It is settled,” she
added in a low voice.Anna Pávlovna had already managed to speak to Lise about
the match she contemplated between Anatole and the little princess’
sister-in-law.“I rely on you, my dear,” said Anna Pávlovna, also in a low tone.
“Write to her and let me know how her father looks at the matter. Au revoir!
”—and she left the hall.Prince Hippolyte approached the little princess and,
bending his face close to her, began to whisper something.Two footmen, the
princess’ and his own, stood holding a shawl and a cloak, waiting for the
conversation to finish. They listened to the French sentences which to them
were meaningless, with an air of understanding but not wishing to appear to do
so. The princess as usual spoke smilingly and listened with a laugh.“I am very
glad I did not go to the ambassador’s,” said Prince Hippolyte “—so dull—. It
has been a delightful evening, has it not? Delightful!”“They say the ball will
be very good,” replied the princess, drawing up her downy little lip. “All the
pretty women in society will be there.”“Not all, for you will not be there; not
all,” said Prince Hippolyte smiling joyfully; and snatching the shawl from the
footman, whom he even pushed aside, he began wrapping it round the princess.
Either from awkwardness or intentionally (no one could have said which) after
the shawl had been adjusted he kept his arm around her for a long time, as
though embracing her.Still smiling, she gracefully moved away, turning and
glancing at her husband. Prince Andrew’s eyes were closed, so weary and sleepy
did he seem.“Are you ready?” he asked his wife, looking past her.Prince
Hippolyte hurriedly put on his cloak, which in the latest fashion reached to
his very heels, and, stumbling in it, ran out into the porch following the
princess, whom a footman was helping into the carriage.“Princesse, au revoir,”
cried he, stumbling with his tongue as well as with his feet.The princess,
picking up her dress, was taking her seat in the dark carriage, her husband was
adjusting his saber; Prince Hippolyte, under pretense of helping, was in
everyone’s way.“Allow me, sir,” said Prince Andrew in Russian in a cold,
disagreeable tone to Prince Hippolyte who was blocking his path.“I am expecting
you, Pierre,” said the same voice, but gently and affectionately.The postilion
started, the carriage wheels rattled. Prince Hippolyte laughed spasmodically as
he stood in the porch waiting for the vicomte whom he had promised to take
home.“Well, mon cher,” said the vicomte, having seated himself beside Hippolyte
in the carriage, “your little princess is very nice, very nice indeed, quite
French,” and he kissed the tips of his fingers. Hippolyte burst out
laughing.“Do you know, you are a terrible chap for all your innocent airs,”
continued the vicomte. “I pity the poor husband, that little officer who gives
himself the airs of a monarch.”Hippolyte spluttered again, and amid his
laughter said, “And you were saying that the Russian ladies are not equal to
the French? One has to know how to deal with them.”Pierre reaching the house
first went into Prince Andrew’s study like one quite at home, and from habit
immediately lay down on the sofa, took from the shelf the first book that came
to his hand (it was Caesar’s Commentaries), and resting on his elbow, began
reading it in the middle.“What have you done to Mlle Schérer? She will be quite
ill now,” said Prince Andrew, as he entered the study, rubbing his small white
hands.Pierre turned his whole body, making the sofa creak. He lifted his eager
face to Prince Andrew, smiled, and waved his hand.“That abbé is very
interesting but he does not see the thing in the right light.... In my opinion
perpetual peace is possible but—I do not know how to express it ... not by a
balance of political power....”It was evident that Prince Andrew was not
interested in such abstract conversation.“One can’t everywhere say all one
thinks, mon cher. Well, have you at last decided on anything? Are you going to
be a guardsman or a diplomatist?” asked Prince Andrew after a momentary
silence.Pierre sat up on the sofa, with his legs tucked under him.“Really, I
don’t yet know. I don’t like either the one or the other.”“But you must decide
on something! Your father expects it.”Pierre at the age of ten had been sent
abroad with an abbé as tutor, and had remained away till he was twenty. When he
returned to Moscow his father dismissed the abbé and said to the young man,
“Now go to Petersburg, look round, and choose your profession. I will agree to
anything. Here is a letter to Prince Vasíli, and here is money. Write to me all
about it, and I will help you in everything.” Pierre had already been choosing
a career for three months, and had not decided on anything. It was about this
choice that Prince Andrew was speaking. Pierre rubbed his forehead.“But he must
be a Freemason,” said he, referring to the abbé whom he had met that
evening.“That is all nonsense.” Prince Andrew again interrupted him, “let us
talk business. Have you been to the Horse Guards?”“No, I have not; but this is
what I have been thinking and wanted to tell you. There is a war now against
Napoleon. If it were a war for freedom I could understand it and should be the
first to enter the army; but to help England and Austria against the greatest
man in the world is not right.”Prince Andrew only shrugged his shoulders at
Pierre’s childish words. He put on the air of one who finds it impossible to
reply to such nonsense, but it would in fact have been difficult to give any
other answer than the one Prince Andrew gave to this naïve question.“If no one
fought except on his own conviction, there would be no wars,” he said.“And that
would be splendid,” said Pierre.Prince Andrew smiled ironically.“Very likely it
would be splendid, but it will never come about....”“Well, why are you going to
the war?” asked Pierre.“What for? I don’t know. I must. Besides that I am
going....” He paused. “I am going because the life I am leading here does not
suit me!”CHAPTER VII The rustle of a woman’s dress was heard in the next room.
Prince Andrew shook himself as if waking up, and his face assumed the look it
had had in Anna Pávlovna’s drawing room. Pierre removed his feet from the sofa.
The princess came in. She had changed her gown for a house dress as fresh and
elegant as the other. Prince Andrew rose and politely placed a chair for
her.“How is it,” she began, as usual in French, settling down briskly and
fussily in the easy chair, “how is it Annette never got married? How stupid you
men all are not to have married her! Excuse me for saying so, but you have no
sense about women. What an argumentative fellow you are, Monsieur Pierre!”“And
I am still arguing with your husband. I can’t understand why he wants to go to
the war,” replied Pierre, addressing the princess with none of the
embarrassment so commonly shown by young men in their intercourse with young
women.The princess started. Evidently Pierre’s words touched her to the
quick.“Ah, that is just what I tell him!” said she. “I don’t understand it; I
don’t in the least understand why men can’t live without wars. How is it that
we women don’t want anything of the kind, don’t need it? Now you shall judge
between us. I always tell him: Here he is Uncle’s aide-de-camp, a most
brilliant position. He is so well known, so much appreciated by everyone. The
other day at the Apráksins’ I heard a lady asking, ‘Is that the famous Prince
Andrew?’ I did indeed.” She laughed. “He is so well received everywhere. He
might easily become aide-de-camp to the Emperor. You know the Emperor spoke to
him most graciously. Annette and I were speaking of how to arrange it. What do
you think?”Pierre looked at his friend and, noticing that he did not like the
conversation, gave no reply.“When are you starting?” he asked.“Oh, don’t speak
of his going, don’t! I won’t hear it spoken of,” said the princess in the same
petulantly playful tone in which she had spoken to Hippolyte in the drawing
room and which was so plainly ill-suited to the family circle of which Pierre
was almost a member. “Today when I remembered that all these delightful
associations must be broken off ... and then you know, André...” (she looked
significantly at her husband) “I’m afraid, I’m afraid!” she whispered, and a
shudder ran down her back.Her husband looked at her as if surprised to notice
that someone besides Pierre and himself was in the room, and addressed her in a
tone of frigid politeness.“What is it you are afraid of, Lise? I don’t
understand,” said he.“There, what egotists men all are: all, all egotists! Just
for a whim of his own, goodness only knows why, he leaves me and locks me up
alone in the country.”“With my father and sister, remember,” said Prince Andrew
gently.“Alone all the same, without my friends.... And he expects me not to be
afraid.”Her tone was now querulous and her lip drawn up, giving her not a
joyful, but an animal, squirrel-like expression. She paused as if she felt it
indecorous to speak of her pregnancy before Pierre, though the gist of the
matter lay in that.“I still can’t understand what you are afraid of,” said
Prince Andrew slowly, not taking his eyes off his wife.The princess blushed,
and raised her arms with a gesture of despair.“No, Andrew, I must say you have
changed. Oh, how you have....”“Your doctor tells you to go to bed earlier,”
said Prince Andrew. “You had better go.”The princess said nothing, but suddenly
her short downy lip quivered. Prince Andrew rose, shrugged his shoulders, and
walked about the room.Pierre looked over his spectacles with naïve surprise,
now at him and now at her, moved as if about to rise too, but changed his
mind.“Why should I mind Monsieur Pierre being here?” exclaimed the little
princess suddenly, her pretty face all at once distorted by a tearful grimace.
“I have long wanted to ask you, Andrew, why you have changed so to me? What
have I done to you? You are going to the war and have no pity for me. Why is
it?”“Lise!” was all Prince Andrew said. But that one word expressed an
entreaty, a threat, and above all conviction that she would herself regret her
words. But she went on hurriedly:“You treat me like an invalid or a child. I
see it all! Did you behave like that six months ago?”“Lise, I beg you to
desist,” said Prince Andrew still more emphatically.Pierre, who had been
growing more and more agitated as he listened to all this, rose and approached
the princess. He seemed unable to bear the sight of tears and was ready to cry
himself.“Calm yourself, Princess! It seems so to you because.... I assure you I
myself have experienced ... and so ... because ... No, excuse me! An outsider
is out of place here.... No, don’t distress yourself.... Good-by!”Prince Andrew
caught him by the hand.“No, wait, Pierre! The princess is too kind to wish to
deprive me of the pleasure of spending the evening with you.”“No, he thinks
only of himself,” muttered the princess without restraining her angry
tears.“Lise!” said Prince Andrew dryly, raising his voice to the pitch which
indicates that patience is exhausted.Suddenly the angry, squirrel-like
expression of the princess’ pretty face changed into a winning and piteous look
of fear. Her beautiful eyes glanced askance at her husband’s face, and her own
assumed the timid, deprecating expression of a dog when it rapidly but feebly
wags its drooping tail.“Mon Dieu, mon Dieu!” she muttered, and lifting her
dress with one hand she went up to her husband and kissed him on the
forehead.“Good night, Lise,” said he, rising and courteously kissing her hand
as he would have done to a stranger.CHAPTER VIII The friends were silent.
Neither cared to begin talking. Pierre continually glanced at Prince Andrew;
Prince Andrew rubbed his forehead with his small hand.“Let us go and have
supper,” he said with a sigh, going to the door.They entered the elegant, newly
decorated, and luxurious dining room. Everything from the table napkins to the
silver, china, and glass bore that imprint of newness found in the households
of the newly married. Halfway through supper Prince Andrew leaned his elbows on
the table and, with a look of nervous agitation such as Pierre had never before
seen on his face, began to talk—as one who has long had something on his mind
and suddenly determines to speak out.“Never, never marry, my dear fellow!
That’s my advice: never marry till you can say to yourself that you have done
all you are capable of, and until you have ceased to love the woman of your
choice and have seen her plainly as she is, or else you will make a cruel and
irrevocable mistake. Marry when you are old and good for nothing—or all that is
good and noble in you will be lost. It will all be wasted on trifles. Yes! Yes!
Yes! Don’t look at me with such surprise. If you marry expecting anything from
yourself in the future, you will feel at every step that for you all is ended,
all is closed except the drawing room, where you will be ranged side by side
with a court lackey and an idiot!... But what’s the good?...” and he waved his
arm.Pierre took off his spectacles, which made his face seem different and the
good-natured expression still more apparent, and gazed at his friend in
amazement.“My wife,” continued Prince Andrew, “is an excellent woman, one of
those rare women with whom a man’s honor is safe; but, O God, what would I not
give now to be unmarried! You are the first and only one to whom I mention
this, because I like you.”As he said this Prince Andrew was less than ever like
that Bolkónski who had lolled in Anna Pávlovna’s easy chairs and with
half-closed eyes had uttered French phrases between his teeth. Every muscle of
his thin face was now quivering with nervous excitement; his eyes, in which the
fire of life had seemed extinguished, now flashed with brilliant light. It was
evident that the more lifeless he seemed at ordinary times, the more
impassioned he became in these moments of almost morbid irritation.“You don’t
understand why I say this,” he continued, “but it is the whole story of life.
You talk of Bonaparte and his career,” said he (though Pierre had not mentioned
Bonaparte), “but Bonaparte when he worked went step by step toward his goal. He
was free, he had nothing but his aim to consider, and he reached it. But tie
yourself up with a woman and, like a chained convict, you lose all freedom! And
all you have of hope and strength merely weighs you down and torments you with
regret. Drawing rooms, gossip, balls, vanity, and triviality—these are the
enchanted circle I cannot escape from. I am now going to the war, the greatest
war there ever was, and I know nothing and am fit for nothing. I am very
amiable and have a caustic wit,” continued Prince Andrew, “and at Anna
Pávlovna’s they listen to me. And that stupid set without whom my wife cannot
exist, and those women.... If you only knew what those society women are, and
women in general! My father is right. Selfish, vain, stupid, trivial in
everything—that’s what women are when you see them in their true colors! When
you meet them in society it seems as if there were something in them, but
there’s nothing, nothing, nothing! No, don’t marry, my dear fellow; don’t
marry!” concluded Prince Andrew.“It seems funny to me,” said Pierre, “that you,
you should consider yourself incapable and your life a spoiled life. You have
everything before you, everything. And you....”He did not finish his sentence,
but his tone showed how highly he thought of his friend and how much he
expected of him in the future.“How can he talk like that?” thought Pierre. He
considered his friend a model of perfection because Prince Andrew possessed in
the highest degree just the very qualities Pierre lacked, and which might be
best described as strength of will. Pierre was always astonished at Prince
Andrew’s calm manner of treating everybody, his extraordinary memory, his
extensive reading (he had read everything, knew everything, and had an opinion
about everything), but above all at his capacity for work and study. And if
Pierre was often struck by Andrew’s lack of capacity for philosophical
meditation (to which he himself was particularly addicted), he regarded even
this not as a defect but as a sign of strength.Even in the best, most friendly
and simplest relations of life, praise and commendation are essential, just as
grease is necessary to wheels that they may run smoothly.“My part is played
out,” said Prince Andrew. “What’s the use of talking about me? Let us talk
about you,” he added after a silence, smiling at his reassuring thoughts.That
smile was immediately reflected on Pierre’s face.“But what is there to say
about me?” said Pierre, his face relaxing into a careless, merry smile. “What
am I? An illegitimate son!” He suddenly blushed crimson, and it was plain that
he had made a great effort to say this. “Without a name and without means...
And it really...” But he did not say what “it really” was. “For the present I
am free and am all right. Only I haven’t the least idea what I am to do; I
wanted to consult you seriously.”Prince Andrew looked kindly at him, yet his
glance—friendly and affectionate as it was—expressed a sense of his own
superiority.“I am fond of you, especially as you are the one live man among our
whole set. Yes, you’re all right! Choose what you will; it’s all the same.
You’ll be all right anywhere. But look here: give up visiting those Kurágins
and leading that sort of life. It suits you so badly—all this debauchery,
dissipation, and the rest of it!”“What would you have, my dear fellow?”
answered Pierre, shrugging his shoulders. “Women, my dear fellow; women!”“I
don’t understand it,” replied Prince Andrew. “Women who are comme il faut,
that’s a different matter; but the Kurágins’ set of women, ‘women and wine’ I
don’t understand!”Pierre was staying at Prince Vasíli Kurágin’s and sharing the
dissipated life of his son Anatole, the son whom they were planning to reform
by marrying him to Prince Andrew’s sister.“Do you know?” said Pierre, as if
suddenly struck by a happy thought, “seriously, I have long been thinking of
it.... Leading such a life I can’t decide or think properly about anything.
One’s head aches, and one spends all one’s money. He asked me for tonight, but
I won’t go.”“You give me your word of honor not to go?”“On my honor!”CHAPTER IX
It was past one o’clock when Pierre left his friend. It was a cloudless,
northern, summer night. Pierre took an open cab intending to drive straight
home. But the nearer he drew to the house the more he felt the impossibility of
going to sleep on such a night. It was light enough to see a long way in the
deserted street and it seemed more like morning or evening than night. On the
way Pierre remembered that Anatole Kurágin was expecting the usual set for
cards that evening, after which there was generally a drinking bout, finishing
with visits of a kind Pierre was very fond of.“I should like to go to
Kurágin’s,” thought he.But he immediately recalled his promise to Prince Andrew
not to go there. Then, as happens to people of weak character, he desired so
passionately once more to enjoy that dissipation he was so accustomed to that
he decided to go. The thought immediately occurred to him that his promise to
Prince Andrew was of no account, because before he gave it he had already
promised Prince Anatole to come to his gathering; “besides,” thought he, “all
such ‘words of honor’ are conventional things with no definite meaning,
especially if one considers that by tomorrow one may be dead, or something so
extraordinary may happen to one that honor and dishonor will be all the same!”
Pierre often indulged in reflections of this sort, nullifying all his decisions
and intentions. He went to Kurágin’s.Reaching the large house near the Horse
Guards’ barracks, in which Anatole lived, Pierre entered the lighted porch,
ascended the stairs, and went in at the open door. There was no one in the
anteroom; empty bottles, cloaks, and overshoes were lying about; there was a
smell of alcohol, and sounds of voices and shouting in the distance.Cards and
supper were over, but the visitors had not yet dispersed. Pierre threw off his
cloak and entered the first room, in which were the remains of supper. A
footman, thinking no one saw him, was drinking on the sly what was left in the
glasses. From the third room came sounds of laughter, the shouting of familiar
voices, the growling of a bear, and general commotion. Some eight or nine young
men were crowding anxiously round an open window. Three others were romping
with a young bear, one pulling him by the chain and trying to set him at the
others.“I bet a hundred on Stevens!” shouted one.“Mind, no holding on!” cried
another.“I bet on Dólokhov!” cried a third. “Kurágin, you part our
hands.”“There, leave Bruin alone; here’s a bet on.”“At one draught, or he
loses!” shouted a fourth.“Jacob, bring a bottle!” shouted the host, a tall,
handsome fellow who stood in the midst of the group, without a coat, and with
his fine linen shirt unfastened in front. “Wait a bit, you fellows.... Here is
Pétya! Good man!” cried he, addressing Pierre.Another voice, from a man of
medium height with clear blue eyes, particularly striking among all these
drunken voices by its sober ring, cried from the window: “Come here; part the
bets!” This was Dólokhov, an officer of the Semënov regiment, a notorious
gambler and duelist, who was living with Anatole. Pierre smiled, looking about
him merrily.“I don’t understand. What’s it all about?”“Wait a bit, he is not
drunk yet! A bottle here,” said Anatole, and taking a glass from the table he
went up to Pierre.“First of all you must drink!”Pierre drank one glass after
another, looking from under his brows at the tipsy guests who were again
crowding round the window, and listening to their chatter. Anatole kept on
refilling Pierre’s glass while explaining that Dólokhov was betting with
Stevens, an English naval officer, that he would drink a bottle of rum sitting
on the outer ledge of the third floor window with his legs hanging out.“Go on,
you must drink it all,” said Anatole, giving Pierre the last glass, “or I won’t
let you go!”“No, I won’t,” said Pierre, pushing Anatole aside, and he went up
to the window.Dólokhov was holding the Englishman’s hand and clearly and
distinctly repeating the terms of the bet, addressing himself particularly to
Anatole and Pierre.Dólokhov was of medium height, with curly hair and
light-blue eyes. He was about twenty-five. Like all infantry officers he wore
no mustache, so that his mouth, the most striking feature of his face, was
clearly seen. The lines of that mouth were remarkably finely curved. The middle
of the upper lip formed a sharp wedge and closed firmly on the firm lower one,
and something like two distinct smiles played continually round the two corners
of the mouth; this, together with the resolute, insolent intelligence of his
eyes, produced an effect which made it impossible not to notice his face.
Dólokhov was a man of small means and no connections. Yet, though Anatole spent
tens of thousands of rubles, Dólokhov lived with him and had placed himself on
such a footing that all who knew them, including Anatole himself, respected him
more than they did Anatole. Dólokhov could play all games and nearly always
won. However much he drank, he never lost his clearheadedness. Both Kurágin and
Dólokhov were at that time notorious among the rakes and scapegraces of
Petersburg.The bottle of rum was brought. The window frame which prevented
anyone from sitting on the outer sill was being forced out by two footmen, who
were evidently flurried and intimidated by the directions and shouts of the
gentlemen around.Anatole with his swaggering air strode up to the window. He
wanted to smash something. Pushing away the footmen he tugged at the frame, but
could not move it. He smashed a pane.“You have a try, Hercules,” said he,
turning to Pierre.Pierre seized the crossbeam, tugged, and wrenched the oak
frame out with a crash.“Take it right out, or they’ll think I’m holding on,”
said Dólokhov.“Is the Englishman bragging?... Eh? Is it all right?” said
Anatole.“First-rate,” said Pierre, looking at Dólokhov, who with a bottle of
rum in his hand was approaching the window, from which the light of the sky,
the dawn merging with the afterglow of sunset, was visible.Dólokhov, the bottle
of rum still in his hand, jumped onto the window sill. “Listen!” cried he,
standing there and addressing those in the room. All were silent.“I bet fifty
imperials”—he spoke French that the Englishman might understand him, but he did
not speak it very well—“I bet fifty imperials ... or do you wish to make it a
hundred?” added he, addressing the Englishman.“No, fifty,” replied the
latter.“All right. Fifty imperials ... that I will drink a whole bottle of rum
without taking it from my mouth, sitting outside the window on this spot” (he
stooped and pointed to the sloping ledge outside the window) “and without
holding on to anything. Is that right?”“Quite right,” said the
Englishman.Anatole turned to the Englishman and taking him by one of the
buttons of his coat and looking down at him—the Englishman was short—began
repeating the terms of the wager to him in English.“Wait!” cried Dólokhov,
hammering with the bottle on the window sill to attract attention. “Wait a bit,
Kurágin. Listen! If anyone else does the same, I will pay him a hundred
imperials. Do you understand?”The Englishman nodded, but gave no indication
whether he intended to accept this challenge or not. Anatole did not release
him, and though he kept nodding to show that he understood, Anatole went on
translating Dólokhov’s words into English. A thin young lad, an hussar of the
Life Guards, who had been losing that evening, climbed on the window sill,
leaned over, and looked down.“Oh! Oh! Oh!” he muttered, looking down from the
window at the stones of the pavement.“Shut up!” cried Dólokhov, pushing him
away from the window. The lad jumped awkwardly back into the room, tripping
over his spurs.Placing the bottle on the window sill where he could reach it
easily, Dólokhov climbed carefully and slowly through the window and lowered
his legs. Pressing against both sides of the window, he adjusted himself on his
seat, lowered his hands, moved a little to the right and then to the left, and
took up the bottle. Anatole brought two candles and placed them on the window
sill, though it was already quite light. Dólokhov’s back in his white shirt,
and his curly head, were lit up from both sides. Everyone crowded to the
window, the Englishman in front. Pierre stood smiling but silent. One man,
older than the others present, suddenly pushed forward with a scared and angry
look and wanted to seize hold of Dólokhov’s shirt.“I say, this is folly! He’ll
be killed,” said this more sensible man.Anatole stopped him.“Don’t touch him!
You’ll startle him and then he’ll be killed. Eh?... What then?... Eh?”Dólokhov
turned round and, again holding on with both hands, arranged himself on his
seat.“If anyone comes meddling again,” said he, emitting the words separately
through his thin compressed lips, “I will throw him down there. Now
then!”Saying this he again turned round, dropped his hands, took the bottle and
lifted it to his lips, threw back his head, and raised his free hand to balance
himself. One of the footmen who had stooped to pick up some broken glass
remained in that position without taking his eyes from the window and from
Dólokhov’s back. Anatole stood erect with staring eyes. The Englishman looked
on sideways, pursing up his lips. The man who had wished to stop the affair ran
to a corner of the room and threw himself on a sofa with his face to the wall.
Pierre hid his face, from which a faint smile forgot to fade though his
features now expressed horror and fear. All were still. Pierre took his hands
from his eyes. Dólokhov still sat in the same position, only his head was
thrown further back till his curly hair touched his shirt collar, and the hand
holding the bottle was lifted higher and higher and trembled with the effort.
The bottle was emptying perceptibly and rising still higher and his head
tilting yet further back. “Why is it so long?” thought Pierre. It seemed to him
that more than half an hour had elapsed. Suddenly Dólokhov made a backward
movement with his spine, and his arm trembled nervously; this was sufficient to
cause his whole body to slip as he sat on the sloping ledge. As he began
slipping down, his head and arm wavered still more with the strain. One hand
moved as if to clutch the window sill, but refrained from touching it. Pierre
again covered his eyes and thought he would never open them again. Suddenly he
was aware of a stir all around. He looked up: Dólokhov was standing on the
window sill, with a pale but radiant face.“It’s empty.”He threw the bottle to
the Englishman, who caught it neatly. Dólokhov jumped down. He smelt strongly
of rum.“Well done!... Fine fellow!... There’s a bet for you!... Devil take
you!” came from different sides.The Englishman took out his purse and began
counting out the money. Dólokhov stood frowning and did not speak. Pierre
jumped upon the window sill.“Gentlemen, who wishes to bet with me? I’ll do the
same thing!” he suddenly cried. “Even without a bet, there! Tell them to bring
me a bottle. I’ll do it.... Bring a bottle!”“Let him do it, let him do it,”
said Dólokhov, smiling.“What next? Have you gone mad?... No one would let
you!... Why, you go giddy even on a staircase,” exclaimed several voices.“I’ll
drink it! Let’s have a bottle of rum!” shouted Pierre, banging the table with a
determined and drunken gesture and preparing to climb out of the window.They
seized him by his arms; but he was so strong that everyone who touched him was
sent flying.“No, you’ll never manage him that way,” said Anatole. “Wait a bit
and I’ll get round him.... Listen! I’ll take your bet tomorrow, but now we are
all going to ——’s.”“Come on then,” cried Pierre. “Come on!... And we’ll take
Bruin with us.”And he caught the bear, took it in his arms, lifted it from the
ground, and began dancing round the room with it.CHAPTER X Prince Vasíli kept
the promise he had given to Princess Drubetskáya who had spoken to him on
behalf of her only son Borís on the evening of Anna Pávlovna’s soiree. The
matter was mentioned to the Emperor, an exception made, and Borís transferred
into the regiment of Semënov Guards with the rank of cornet. He received,
however, no appointment to Kutúzov’s staff despite all Anna Mikháylovna’s
endeavors and entreaties. Soon after Anna Pávlovna’s reception Anna Mikháylovna
returned to Moscow and went straight to her rich relations, the Rostóvs, with
whom she stayed when in the town and where her darling Bóry, who had only just
entered a regiment of the line and was being at once transferred to the Guards
as a cornet, had been educated from childhood and lived for years at a time.
The Guards had already left Petersburg on the tenth of August, and her son, who
had remained in Moscow for his equipment, was to join them on the march to
Radzivílov.It was St. Natalia’s day and the name day of two of the Rostóvs—the
mother and the youngest daughter—both named Nataly. Ever since the morning,
carriages with six horses had been coming and going continually, bringing
visitors to the Countess Rostóva’s big house on the Povarskáya, so well known
to all Moscow. The countess herself and her handsome eldest daughter were in
the drawing room with the visitors who came to congratulate, and who constantly
succeeded one another in relays.The countess was a woman of about forty-five,
with a thin Oriental type of face, evidently worn out with childbearing—she had
had twelve. A languor of motion and speech, resulting from weakness, gave her a
distinguished air which inspired respect. Princess Anna Mikháylovna
Drubetskáya, who as a member of the household was also seated in the drawing
room, helped to receive and entertain the visitors. The young people were in
one of the inner rooms, not considering it necessary to take part in receiving
the visitors. The count met the guests and saw them off, inviting them all to
dinner.“I am very, very grateful to you, mon cher,” or “ma chère”—he called
everyone without exception and without the slightest variation in his tone, “my
dear,” whether they were above or below him in rank—“I thank you for myself and
for our two dear ones whose name day we are keeping. But mind you come to
dinner or I shall be offended, ma chère! On behalf of the whole family I beg
you to come, mon cher!” These words he repeated to everyone without exception
or variation, and with the same expression on his full, cheerful, clean-shaven
face, the same firm pressure of the hand and the same quick, repeated bows. As
soon as he had seen a visitor off he returned to one of those who were still in
the drawing room, drew a chair toward him or her, and jauntily spreading out
his legs and putting his hands on his knees with the air of a man who enjoys
life and knows how to live, he swayed to and fro with dignity, offered surmises
about the weather, or touched on questions of health, sometimes in Russian and
sometimes in very bad but self-confident French; then again, like a man weary
but unflinching in the fulfillment of duty, he rose to see some visitors off
and, stroking his scanty gray hairs over his bald patch, also asked them to
dinner. Sometimes on his way back from the anteroom he would pass through the
conservatory and pantry into the large marble dining hall, where tables were
being set out for eighty people; and looking at the footmen, who were bringing
in silver and china, moving tables, and unfolding damask table linen, he would
call Dmítri Vasílevich, a man of good family and the manager of all his
affairs, and while looking with pleasure at the enormous table would say:
“Well, Dmítri, you’ll see that things are all as they should be? That’s right!
The great thing is the serving, that’s it.” And with a complacent sigh he would
return to the drawing room.“Márya Lvóvna Karágina and her daughter!” announced
the countess’ gigantic footman in his bass voice, entering the drawing room.
The countess reflected a moment and took a pinch from a gold snuffbox with her
husband’s portrait on it.“I’m quite worn out by these callers. However, I’ll
see her and no more. She is so affected. Ask her in,” she said to the footman
in a sad voice, as if saying: “Very well, finish me off.”A tall, stout, and
proud-looking woman, with a round-faced smiling daughter, entered the drawing
room, their dresses rustling.“Dear Countess, what an age... She has been laid
up, poor child ... at the Razumóvski’s ball ... and Countess Apráksina ... I
was so delighted...” came the sounds of animated feminine voices, interrupting
one another and mingling with the rustling of dresses and the scraping of
chairs. Then one of those conversations began which last out until, at the
first pause, the guests rise with a rustle of dresses and say, “I am so
delighted... Mamma’s health... and Countess Apráksina...” and then, again
rustling, pass into the anteroom, put on cloaks or mantles, and drive away. The
conversation was on the chief topic of the day: the illness of the wealthy and
celebrated beau of Catherine’s day, Count Bezúkhov, and about his illegitimate
son Pierre, the one who had behaved so improperly at Anna Pávlovna’s
reception.“I am so sorry for the poor count,” said the visitor. “He is in such
bad health, and now this vexation about his son is enough to kill him!”“What is
that?” asked the countess as if she did not know what the visitor alluded to,
though she had already heard about the cause of Count Bezúkhov’s distress some
fifteen times.“That’s what comes of a modern education,” exclaimed the visitor.
“It seems that while he was abroad this young man was allowed to do as he
liked, now in Petersburg I hear he has been doing such terrible things that he
has been expelled by the police.”“You don’t say so!” replied the countess.“He
chose his friends badly,” interposed Anna Mikháylovna. “Prince Vasíli’s son,
he, and a certain Dólokhov have, it is said, been up to heaven only knows what!
And they have had to suffer for it. Dólokhov has been degraded to the ranks and
Bezúkhov’s son sent back to Moscow. Anatole Kurágin’s father managed somehow to
get his son’s affair hushed up, but even he was ordered out of Petersburg.”“But
what have they been up to?” asked the countess.“They are regular brigands,
especially Dólokhov,” replied the visitor. “He is a son of Márya Ivánovna
Dólokhova, such a worthy woman, but there, just fancy! Those three got hold of
a bear somewhere, put it in a carriage, and set off with it to visit some
actresses! The police tried to interfere, and what did the young men do? They
tied a policeman and the bear back to back and put the bear into the Moyka
Canal. And there was the bear swimming about with the policeman on his
back!”“What a nice figure the policeman must have cut, my dear!” shouted the
count, dying with laughter.“Oh, how dreadful! How can you laugh at it,
Count?”Yet the ladies themselves could not help laughing.“It was all they could
do to rescue the poor man,” continued the visitor. “And to think it is Cyril
Vladímirovich Bezúkhov’s son who amuses himself in this sensible manner! And he
was said to be so well educated and clever. This is all that his foreign
education has done for him! I hope that here in Moscow no one will receive him,
in spite of his money. They wanted to introduce him to me, but I quite
declined: I have my daughters to consider.”“Why do you say this young man is so
rich?” asked the countess, turning away from the girls, who at once assumed an
air of inattention. “His children are all illegitimate. I think Pierre also is
illegitimate.”The visitor made a gesture with her hand.“I should think he has a
score of them.”Princess Anna Mikháylovna intervened in the conversation,
evidently wishing to show her connections and knowledge of what went on in
society.“The fact of the matter is,” said she significantly, and also in a half
whisper, “everyone knows Count Cyril’s reputation.... He has lost count of his
children, but this Pierre was his favorite.”“How handsome the old man still was
only a year ago!” remarked the countess. “I have never seen a handsomer
man.”“He is very much altered now,” said Anna Mikháylovna. “Well, as I was
saying, Prince Vasíli is the next heir through his wife, but the count is very
fond of Pierre, looked after his education, and wrote to the Emperor about him;
so that in the case of his death—and he is so ill that he may die at any
moment, and Dr. Lorrain has come from Petersburg—no one knows who will inherit
his immense fortune, Pierre or Prince Vasíli. Forty thousand serfs and millions
of rubles! I know it all very well for Prince Vasíli told me himself. Besides,
Cyril Vladímirovich is my mother’s second cousin. He’s also my Bóry’s
godfather,” she added, as if she attached no importance at all to the
fact.“Prince Vasíli arrived in Moscow yesterday. I hear he has come on some
inspection business,” remarked the visitor.“Yes, but between ourselves,” said
the princess, “that is a pretext. The fact is he has come to see Count Cyril
Vladímirovich, hearing how ill he is.”“But do you know, my dear, that was a
capital joke,” said the count; and seeing that the elder visitor was not
listening, he turned to the young ladies. “I can just imagine what a funny
figure that policeman cut!”And as he waved his arms to impersonate the
policeman, his portly form again shook with a deep ringing laugh, the laugh of
one who always eats well and, in particular, drinks well. “So do come and dine
with us!” he said.CHAPTER XI Silence ensued. The countess looked at her
callers, smiling affably, but not concealing the fact that she would not be
distressed if they now rose and took their leave. The visitor’s daughter was
already smoothing down her dress with an inquiring look at her mother, when
suddenly from the next room were heard the footsteps of boys and girls running
to the door and the noise of a chair falling over, and a girl of thirteen,
hiding something in the folds of her short muslin frock, darted in and stopped
short in the middle of the room. It was evident that she had not intended her
flight to bring her so far. Behind her in the doorway appeared a student with a
crimson coat collar, an officer of the Guards, a girl of fifteen, and a plump
rosy-faced boy in a short jacket.The count jumped up and, swaying from side to
side, spread his arms wide and threw them round the little girl who had run
in.“Ah, here she is!” he exclaimed laughing. “My pet, whose name day it is. My
dear pet!”“Ma chère, there is a time for everything,” said the countess with
feigned severity. “You spoil her, Ilyá,” she added, turning to her husband.“How
do you do, my dear? I wish you many happy returns of your name day,” said the
visitor. “What a charming child,” she added, addressing the mother.This
black-eyed, wide-mouthed girl, not pretty but full of life—with childish bare
shoulders which after her run heaved and shook her bodice, with black curls
tossed backward, thin bare arms, little legs in lace-frilled drawers, and feet
in low slippers—was just at that charming age when a girl is no longer a child,
though the child is not yet a young woman. Escaping from her father she ran to
hide her flushed face in the lace of her mother’s mantilla—not paying the least
attention to her severe remark—and began to laugh. She laughed, and in
fragmentary sentences tried to explain about a doll which she produced from the
folds of her frock.“Do you see?... My doll... Mimi... You see...” was all
Natásha managed to utter (to her everything seemed funny). She leaned against
her mother and burst into such a loud, ringing fit of laughter that even the
prim visitor could not help joining in.“Now then, go away and take your
monstrosity with you,” said the mother, pushing away her daughter with
pretended sternness, and turning to the visitor she added: “She is my youngest
girl.”Natásha, raising her face for a moment from her mother’s mantilla,
glanced up at her through tears of laughter, and again hid her face.The
visitor, compelled to look on at this family scene, thought it necessary to
take some part in it.“Tell me, my dear,” said she to Natásha, “is Mimi a
relation of yours? A daughter, I suppose?”Natásha did not like the visitor’s
tone of condescension to childish things. She did not reply, but looked at her
seriously.Meanwhile the younger generation: Borís, the officer, Anna
Mikháylovna’s son; Nicholas, the undergraduate, the count’s eldest son; Sónya,
the count’s fifteen-year-old niece, and little Pétya, his youngest boy, had all
settled down in the drawing room and were obviously trying to restrain within
the bounds of decorum the excitement and mirth that shone in all their faces.
Evidently in the back rooms, from which they had dashed out so impetuously, the
conversation had been more amusing than the drawing room talk of society
scandals, the weather, and Countess Apráksina. Now and then they glanced at one
another, hardly able to suppress their laughter.The two young men, the student
and the officer, friends from childhood, were of the same age and both handsome
fellows, though not alike. Borís was tall and fair, and his calm and handsome
face had regular, delicate features. Nicholas was short with curly hair and an
open expression. Dark hairs were already showing on his upper lip, and his
whole face expressed impetuosity and enthusiasm. Nicholas blushed when he
entered the drawing room. He evidently tried to find something to say, but
failed. Borís on the contrary at once found his footing, and related quietly
and humorously how he had known that doll Mimi when she was still quite a young
lady, before her nose was broken; how she had aged during the five years he had
known her, and how her head had cracked right across the skull. Having said
this he glanced at Natásha. She turned away from him and glanced at her younger
brother, who was screwing up his eyes and shaking with suppressed laughter, and
unable to control herself any longer, she jumped up and rushed from the room as
fast as her nimble little feet would carry her. Borís did not laugh.“You were
meaning to go out, weren’t you, Mamma? Do you want the carriage?” he asked his
mother with a smile.“Yes, yes, go and tell them to get it ready,” she answered,
returning his smile.Borís quietly left the room and went in search of Natásha.
The plump boy ran after them angrily, as if vexed that their program had been
disturbed.CHAPTER XII The only young people remaining in the drawing room, not
counting the young lady visitor and the countess’ eldest daughter (who was four
years older than her sister and behaved already like a grown-up person), were
Nicholas and Sónya, the niece. Sónya was a slender little brunette with a
tender look in her eyes which were veiled by long lashes, thick black plaits
coiling twice round her head, and a tawny tint in her complexion and especially
in the color of her slender but graceful and muscular arms and neck. By the
grace of her movements, by the softness and flexibility of her small limbs, and
by a certain coyness and reserve of manner, she reminded one of a pretty,
half-grown kitten which promises to become a beautiful little cat. She
evidently considered it proper to show an interest in the general conversation
by smiling, but in spite of herself her eyes under their thick long lashes
watched her cousin who was going to join the army, with such passionate girlish
adoration that her smile could not for a single instant impose upon anyone, and
it was clear that the kitten had settled down only to spring up with more
energy and again play with her cousin as soon as they too could, like Natásha
and Borís, escape from the drawing room.“Ah yes, my dear,” said the count,
addressing the visitor and pointing to Nicholas, “his friend Borís has become
an officer, and so for friendship’s sake he is leaving the university and me,
his old father, and entering the military service, my dear. And there was a
place and everything waiting for him in the Archives Department! Isn’t that
friendship?” remarked the count in an inquiring tone.“But they say that war has
been declared,” replied the visitor.“They’ve been saying so a long while,” said
the count, “and they’ll say so again and again, and that will be the end of it.
My dear, there’s friendship for you,” he repeated. “He’s joining the
hussars.”The visitor, not knowing what to say, shook her head.“It’s not at all
from friendship,” declared Nicholas, flaring up and turning away as if from a
shameful aspersion. “It is not from friendship at all; I simply feel that the
army is my vocation.”He glanced at his cousin and the young lady visitor; and
they were both regarding him with a smile of approbation.“Schubert, the colonel
of the Pávlograd Hussars, is dining with us today. He has been here on leave
and is taking Nicholas back with him. It can’t be helped!” said the count,
shrugging his shoulders and speaking playfully of a matter that evidently
distressed him.“I have already told you, Papa,” said his son, “that if you
don’t wish to let me go, I’ll stay. But I know I am no use anywhere except in
the army; I am not a diplomat or a government clerk.—I don’t know how to hide
what I feel.” As he spoke he kept glancing with the flirtatiousness of a
handsome youth at Sónya and the young lady visitor.The little kitten, feasting
her eyes on him, seemed ready at any moment to start her gambols again and
display her kittenish nature.“All right, all right!” said the old count. “He
always flares up! This Buonaparte has turned all their heads; they all think of
how he rose from an ensign and became Emperor. Well, well, God grant it,” he
added, not noticing his visitor’s sarcastic smile.The elders began talking
about Bonaparte. Julie Karágina turned to young Rostóv.“What a pity you weren’t
at the Arkhárovs’ on Thursday. It was so dull without you,” said she, giving
him a tender smile.The young man, flattered, sat down nearer to her with a
coquettish smile, and engaged the smiling Julie in a confidential conversation
without at all noticing that his involuntary smile had stabbed the heart of
Sónya, who blushed and smiled unnaturally. In the midst of his talk he glanced
round at her. She gave him a passionately angry glance, and hardly able to
restrain her tears and maintain the artificial smile on her lips, she got up
and left the room. All Nicholas’ animation vanished. He waited for the first
pause in the conversation, and then with a distressed face left the room to
find Sónya.“How plainly all these young people wear their hearts on their
sleeves!” said Anna Mikháylovna, pointing to Nicholas as he went out.
“Cousinage—dangereux voisinage,” * she added.
